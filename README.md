# MSTU 5013 Project
By: Becca Rosenberg and Mary Babin

Description: An app that is designed for parents of students to understand better what their children are learning in school. This application will allow teachers to publish homework and notify parents via e-mail.  Additionally, parents will use the application to understand the concepts and skills within the homework so they are better able to support their child at home when needed. Parents will be able to send their child's teacher a question directly about that homework assignment so that all questions and answers can be made available for other parents as well.
